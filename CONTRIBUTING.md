## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
If you find bugs, unexpected behavior, or have feature requests:
- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Liarte-Group/Active-Matter-Adjustable-Networks/issues).
- Include:
    - A clear description of the problem or suggestion
    - Steps to reproduce
    - System specifications (OS, GPU, CUDA version)
    - Relevant error messages or logs
- Label the issue appropriately (bug, feature request, question, etc.)

---

### 2. Pull Requests
We welcome pull requests for code improvements, bug fixes, or new features:

1. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch:
```bash
git checkout -b fix-network-boundary
```

2. Implement your changes and make sure:
    - Code compiles without errors
    - Example scripts in `examples/` still run correctly
    - Any new features are documented

3. Submit a pull request with:
    - Clear description of the change
    - Reference to any related issue (if applicable)
    - Instructions for testing your contribution

---

### 3. Code Guidelines
- Folloe the existing **CUDA-C style** (indentation, variable names, modular functions)
- Comment **non-obvious logic**, specially mathematical or algorithmic parts
- Keep functions **modular and reusable**

---

### 4. Communication and Conduct
- Be respectful and professional in comments, issues, and pull requests
- Follow the **scientific and open-source collaboration etiquette**
- Ask questions on issues before implementing large changes
