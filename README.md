# Active-Matter-Adjustable-Networks
This repository contains a CUDA-C framework for simulating **active matter on deformable and dynamically adjustable networks**, with an emphasis on large-scale GPU acceleration.

The code is designed to efficiently simulate systems of **active Brownian particles (ABPs)** moving on lattice-based networks that can undergo **stochastic bond breaking and regeneration**. All simulations are implemented using massively parallel GPU computing, enabling the study of networks with very large system sizes.
